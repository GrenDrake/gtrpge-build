# Text Formatting Codes

Outputted text supports a small array of formatting styles.
The most important is creating new paragraphs.
This can be done by simply inserting a newline (`\n`) into a string.

Other formatting is added through the use of tags.
These are mostly marked up in a style similar to HTML, but using square brackets (`[b]`) instead of angle brackets (`<b>`).
Only a small array of tags are supported; these are listed in the table below.
The `[b]` and `[i]` tags must be closed, like so: `[/b]` and `[/i]`.


Code  | Meaning
------|---------
b     | bold
i     | italic
br    | non-paragraph newline
hr    | horizontal rule
